### CS224 Stanford Assignement 1

You'll find my own version of the assignement 1 of the CS224 Stanford NLP course. 

This course is a guided tutorial of Mikolov's word2vec model. 

You'll find the written anszer in the pdf "CS_224d_assignement_1_Solutions_BenjaminMuller.pdf"

Following the tutorial and using the code I write, you'll be able to train a word2vec model based on Continuous-bag-of-Words or skip-gram model. 

The end of the tutorial consists in using the word-vectors for sentiments analysis.
